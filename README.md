# ai-library-exploration

## Goal of the project

To learn, explore and compare various AI Libraries

## My conclusion

### Fast AI 
- Quite good for deep learning.

### Pycaret
- Cannot do deep learning
- Ridiculously simple to use 
- Good for tabular data

### H2O
- Good for tabular data
- I would prefer H2O over pycaret, but both are very easy to use
- Can also do deep learning
- Supports R if that concerns you
- 
### Autogluon
- Autogluon can mix tabular data and text data. This is awesome
- Autogluon has to have GPU for deep learning otherwise it wont run
- Run time is long even with GPU, although i did not explore measures to reduce run time
- Can also do multi label classification
