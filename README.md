# ai-library-exploration

## Goal of the project

To learn, explore and compare various AI Libraries

## My conclusion

### Fast AI 
Quite good for deep learning.

### Pycaret
Cannot do deep learning
Ridiculously simple to use 
Good for tabular data

### H2O
Good for tabular data
I would prefer H2O over pycaret, but both are very easy to use


### Autogluon
Autogluon can mix tabular data and text data. 
Autogluon has to have GPU for deep learning otherwise it wont run
